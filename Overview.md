# PEN

## Aims

[I like pens. And I like to know where my pens are.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prNQrG_M-ZY) This session, we'll be making a Pen Embezzlement INformant (PEN) in Angular!

The aim is to get you to understand as much Angular as you can without overloading you: you'll each have differing amounts of experience with TypeScript and Angular.

## Before you start

To get going, you'll need to have completed the following setup. Ask your trainer for help if you can't complete any of the steps.

*Even though you'll be pairing, you'll need to set up the following on both people's machines:*

  - Download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): it's very good with TypeScript and AngularJS.
  - Make sure that you have Git, Node.js and npm installed on your machine - you'll need at least version 10.13.0 of Node.
      - Use [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for updating your Node version.

*Pick whoever has the least Angular experience and do the rest on their machine: they'll be driving first when you get started.*

  - Open up a command prompt and navigate to somewhere where you're happy to create a new directory for this project.
  - Run the command `npm install -g @angular/cli` to install the Angular CLI
  - Run `ng new pen` to create a new Angular project, and navigate to the root directory that was created.
  - Create a new empty repository within your GitHub account. When asked if you want to initialize the project with a README, say no.
  - Follow the onscreen instructions to push your new Angular project to GitHub.
  - Email a link to your repository to your trainer.
  - Open up a second command prompt, navigate to your `pen` directory, and run `ng serve --open` to launch your application in a browser.

## TypeScript

If you haven't written in TypeScript before, don't worry! If you've used other typed languages like C# or Java, it should feel reasonably familiar. There's a [TypeScript Cheatsheet](TypescriptCheatsheet.md) available if you'd like something to refer to: make good use of it!
